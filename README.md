You can see there server-part files of Roundraw graphic online editor. \
For more information, enter commands like /list, /flist into telegram-bot https://t.me/nfjkcicicjcnfnvfnbot \
I use file server.return to boot server (it contains all code.) You can see code separately inside bot. \
Actual version of file server.return is placed at https://noopdie.com/server - page generates file in real time, and harvests commands, functions, objects placed on NodeJS Javascript VM Runtime \
